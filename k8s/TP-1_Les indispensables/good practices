Separation of concerns

Using the init container approach means that we would have at least two different container images; an image for the init container, 
which includes all the tooling for setup, and the other is the application image. Having separate images allows us to distribute ownership of 
the images to different teams.

Security

Using init containers can bring some security benefits. Let’s assume that the app requires some assets from a git repository or cloud storage. 
Instead of giving access to the secrets/credentials to the app container, where it might get accessed by an unauthorized party, we can only 
provide access to the init container. Reducing access means that exposure of the secrets/credentials is short-lived and less accessible.

Another aspect is that now we don’t need to install tools that would only be used when the pod starts. Reducing the number of packages and tools 
reduces the attack surface. By moving the tools required at startup to init containers, you can use distroless images for your apps and let the 
init containers work on those tasks.
